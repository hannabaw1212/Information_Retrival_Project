# Information_Retrival_Project

this project is an information retrival system development . The primary objectives of this project are to provide hands-on experience in IR-related tasks, such as language modeling, text classification, and clustering, and to promote teamwork and collaboration among students.

The project consists of the following tasks:

1. Language Modeling:

* Tokenization of the text corpus
* Creation of language models for the collection
* Linguistic operations, including stop-word removal, case folding, and stemming using the Porter algorithm
* Comparison and analysis of the differences between language models

2. Text Classification:

* Random selection and labeling of 50 documents from other directories
*  Linguistic operations, including tokenization and stop-word removal
* Use of a machine learning library (such as WEKA or scikit-learn) to perform 10-fold cross-validation with four classifiers
*  Reporting and discussion of results, including analysis of misclassified documents

3. Text Clustering:

* Collection of documents from three additional directories
* Use of a machine learning library (such as WEKA or scikit-learn) to perform K-means clustering with four clusters
* Analysis of clustering results and explanation of errors


The project involves data collection and sharing among team members, as well as the utilization of freely available tools or the development of custom solutions.
